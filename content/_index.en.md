The Laconic Network is an ecosystem of {{< glossary "laconic-network-member" "Members" >}}, {{< glossary "validator" "Validators" >}}, {{< glossary "service-provider" "Service Providers" >}}, {{< glossary "watcher-publisher" "Watcher Publishers" >}}, and {{< glossary "dapp-operator" "DApp Operators" >}}. The Laconic Network makes blockchain data more accessible, enables independent verifiability via cryptographic proofs, and is a decentralized marketplace for matching DApps with Service Providers to serve custom data APIs known as Watchers.

## What is "Laconic"?

Referencing the ancient inhabitants of Laconia known for their more concise and terse style of speech, <em>Laconic</em> also describes a manner of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas.

It's the perfect name for technology that simplifies the complexity of blockchain and accelerates DApp development.

## What sets Laconic apart?

Apps built on blockchain technology are currently hampered by the middleware that connects it to actual applications. Some solutions already exist to index and store blockchain data, but they largely rely on centralized services to index and serve the data; and they accept and use data that cannot be cryptographically proven to be authentic and accurate. The Laconic Network stands apart by addressing precisely these two fundamental problems â€” it indexes and serves data that is both decentralized and cryptographically provable.
